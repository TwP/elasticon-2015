## Elastic{on} 2015 Talk

This repository exists to collect our GitHub ElasticSearch stories and then
craft them into coherent talk for Elastic{on} 2015. The stories are being
collected in the `stories` directory. Any images and supporting graphs are going
into the `images` folder. The talk itself will live in the `talk` folder.

Please contribute stories if you have any. The basic format of a story follows
the post-mortem format:

* background
* what went wrong
* how we fixed it
* lessons learned

There is an optional "segue" section if there are some extra notes that will
help the talk transition from one story to the next.
